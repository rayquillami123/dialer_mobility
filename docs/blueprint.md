## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color is the same shade of blue used in the logo (#007BFF) to maintain brand consistency.
- Light gray (#F0F4F5) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- The accent color is a lighter shade of blue (#ADD8E6), derived from the logo, to highlight interactive elements.
- 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines; the font provides a modern, clean feel.
- 'Inter' sans-serif for body; if the 'Space Grotesk' is chosen, it pairs nicely with Inter. 'Inter' provides readability and a neutral tone.
- Use clear, simple icons from a consistent set, such as Phosphor, to represent actions like editing or deleting trunks. The icons should have a similar weight and style to the bars in the logo icon.
- Use a card-based layout for trunk listings and forms, with consistent spacing and padding for a professional look.
